## Install

### Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew tap tooyipjee/dot
brew install --cask dot
```

### Download

Grab the latest `.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/tooyipjee/dot/releases).

### Gatekeeper bypass

Since the app is not code-signed, macOS will show a warning on first launch. To fix:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/dot.app
```

Or right-click the app → Open → confirm.
